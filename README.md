# batch-script-tools

This is a collection of old tools I made in batch script in middle school. These are simple enough that they don't deserve their own repository, but they're useful enough that I decided not to delete them.

## account-timeout.bat

Prompts the user for a number of seconds, then shuts down after the time specified.

## command-prompt.bat

This is a simple workaround I made to get command prompt on computers where it was blocked.

Batch files couldn't be blocked because the school used them to map the shared drives when we logged in, but they blocked us from running command prompt on its own.

## quick-website-maker.bat

Prompts the user for the website's name, then builds a template HTML file.

## restart-explorer.bat

Restarts `explorer.exe`, the Windows desktop.

Sometimes Windows would start lagging, and this would usually fix it.

## task-killer.bat

Force kills a task specified by the user.

## task-manager.bat

This is a simple workaround I made to get a terminal-based task manager, since taskman was blocked.

This program lists the tasks running and lets you start or stop tasks.
